      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # This action brings your repository's code onto the runner.
      - name: Checkout repository

      # Step 3: Install system dependencies (including a full TeX Live distribution)
      # This step now installs 'texlive-full' which provides a comprehensive LaTeX environment,
      # including xelatex, fonts, and common packages.
      # Also includes other non-LaTeX dependencies for R packages.
